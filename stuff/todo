TODO
stuff i should do sometimes later:
 - do you want to leave this page?
 - check access rights for files and folders
 - make Strg+C work to quit commands
  - make ping continus like the real one
 - save space by not saving complete pcs but only the seeds

BUGS
minor:
 - when you go from a pc via ssh to the same pc, then switch the folder and then go back, we are still in the same folder
 - filenames cannot consist only of numbers
major:
 - remove save command directly from process stack (else it will still be there when the save is loaded)
 - downloading the same files twice results in two files
