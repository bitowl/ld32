TODO
stuff i should do sometimes later:
 - make 127.0.0.1 always your own pc
 - check access rights for files and folders
 - make Strg+C work to quit commands
  - make ping continus like the real one


BUGS
minor:
 - when you go from a pc via ssh to the same pc, then switch the folder and then go back, we are still in the same folder
