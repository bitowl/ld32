Past goals:
- get a command line working where you can enter commands and print stuff
- parse and handle commands
- create users with passwords
- create multiple computers

Current goal:
- create commands to communicate between computers

Next goals:
- create a working "file system" with contents
 - place the programs you can use into real files?
- create programs and viruses/exploits to hack them
- check access rights for all commands
- save the current progress in local storage
- random computers in the network you can hack and take over
 - based on presets
 - username generator
 - password generator
  - define the strength of a password
 - file generator

Further Ideas:
- irc/email to get tutorial infos

- command history (up/down)
- copy/paste? :/
- running programms parallel (so you are not bored while waiting for your pwcrackers)
- turn the whole thing into a browsergame :D
