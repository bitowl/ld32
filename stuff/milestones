Past goals:
- get a command line working where you can enter commands and print stuff
- parse and handle commands

Current goal:
- create a working "file system"

Next goals:
- create multiple computers
- create commands to communicate between computers
- create programs and viruses/exploits to hack them
- save the current progress in local storage

Further Ideas:
- irc/email to get tutorial infos
- random computers in the network you can hack and take over
- turn the whole thing into a browsergame :D
